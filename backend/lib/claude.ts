${promptsList}

Identify recurring themes, struggles, or repeated requests (e.g., "center a div" appearing often means the learner struggles with layout and alignment in CSS). For each recurring theme, extract a generalized coding concept that could be taught to help the learner improve (e.g., "Flexbox Model Centering Techniques"). Group similar ideas into one concept, so that there are three concepts in total. For example, the centering a div example from earlier could go in a category with other exercises called "Flexbox Layout". Prioritize clarity and conciseness: each concept should be 3â€“7 words and written in a way that makes sense as a teachable skill. Make sure that ONLY 3 concepts are output, no more, no less. If there are prior concepts that have been generated, look at that table:

${conceptsList}

If any of the new concepts are very similar to it, do not come up with a new concept name, use the same name as the old concept.`;
