Vibe Labs uses your AI Copilot prompting history (e.g., Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf) to generate personalized coding exercises tailored to your style and habits. It teaches you to solve your most common, easy-to-solve prompts, saving the time you would otherwise spend waiting for each repetitive prompt, boosting the efficiency of your vibe coding and improving your programming skills.
